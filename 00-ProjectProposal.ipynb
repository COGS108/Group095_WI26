  "Our project focuses on the relationship between air pollution particulate matter levels and the birth weights of babies in that area. According to the NIH, women have a “20% increase in oxygen consumption, a 40% to 50% increase in minute ventilation, and a 40% increase in cardiac output” when they are pregnant (Aguilera et al.).<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This leads us to believe that pregnant women are more vulnerable to air pollution due to their increased intake and circulation of the particles. Moreover, an NIH study found that maternally inhaled carbonaceous air pollution particles can cross the placenta and then translocate into human fetal organs during gestation (Aguilera et al.).<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) These NIH studies lead us to believe that air pollutants are reaching fetuses while they are in the womb, which convinces us that the baby’s birth weight will be affected by the amount of exposure to particulates since air pollutants are linked to a number of heart and lung problems.\n",
"\n",
"Since air pollution is a major environmental health concern, fine particulate matter (especially PM2.5, particles ≤2.5 micrometers) can be small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Pregnancy is a particularly sensitive period to the effects of fine particulate matter because fetal growth depends on consistent oxygen and nutrient delivery. Our project is going to determine the relationship between these two variables. One major prior work relevant to our project is a 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis that examined associations between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) and low birth weight.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This study pooled results from multiple cohort studies and found that exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of low birth weight, with consistent associations observed across trimesters. These findings support the hypothesis that higher levels of particulate air pollution can negatively impact fetal growth.\n",

    "We predict that higher air pollution rates will be correlated with lower birth weights in that area.
