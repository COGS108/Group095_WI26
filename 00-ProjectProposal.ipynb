  "Our project focuses on the relationship between air pollution particulate matter levels and the birth weights of babies in that area. According to the NIH, women have a “20% increase in oxygen consumption, a 40% to 50% increase in minute ventilation, and a 40% increase in cardiac output” when they are pregnant (Aguilera et al.).<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This leads us to believe that pregnant women are more vulnerable to air pollution due to their increased intake and circulation of the particles. Moreover, an NIH study found that maternally inhaled carbonaceous air pollution particles can cross the placenta and then translocate into human fetal organs during gestation (Aguilera et al.).<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) These NIH studies lead us to believe that air pollutants are reaching fetuses while they are in the womb, which convinces us that the baby’s birth weight will be affected by the amount of exposure to particulates since air pollutants are linked to a number of heart and lung problems.\n",
"\n",
"Since air pollution is a major environmental health concern, fine particulate matter (especially PM2.5, particles ≤2.5 micrometers) can be small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Pregnancy is a particularly sensitive period to the effects of fine particulate matter because fetal growth depends on consistent oxygen and nutrient delivery. Our project is going to determine the relationship between these two variables. One major prior work relevant to our project is a 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis that examined associations between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) and low birth weight.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This study pooled results from multiple cohort studies and found that exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of low birth weight, with consistent associations observed across trimesters. These findings support the hypothesis that higher levels of particulate air pollution can negatively impact fetal growth.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We predict that higher air pollution rates will be correlated with lower birth weights in that area. Due to the increased air particle intake by pregnant women and the permeability of the placenta to pollutants, we believe that higher rates of air pollution will be correlated with lower birth weights. Additionally, multiple previous NIH studies have reported negative associations between birth weight and PM2.5.\n"

   "source": [
     "Our dataset will have variables involving the amount of air pollutants in California, such as particulate matter (PM2.5). These are typically continuous variables measured in ug/m3 (and sometimes parts per million).\n",
  "\n",
  "We would need to combine the above dataset with a dataset detailing pregnancy birth outcomes. We will focus on birth weights, a continuous numeric variable measured in ounces. From brief research, birth weight is also sometimes measured as a discrete categorical variable (i.e., “very low,” “low,” “normal,” etc.).\n",
  "\n",
  "The potential time period for our analysis will focus on the years 2020 through 2023.\n",
  "\n",
  "One potential source for air pollution data is a Kaggle dataset that contains PM2.5 measurements in numerous California counties for the year 2020. This dataset reports PM2.5 levels in ug/m3 in numerous California counties.\n",
  "\n",
  "Another relevant source is the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality datasets  from 1980 to 2025 for every U.S. state. These datasets can be filtered to include only California. In particular, the “Annual concentration by monitor” dataset reports measurements for PM2.5, ozone, and other pollutants, while the “Annual AQI by county” uses Air Quality Index but does not specify exact pollutant amounts.\n",
  "\n",
  "Additional California-specific air quality data is available that allows sorting by county, pollutant type, and year, which may help align pollution exposure with birth outcome data at the county level.\n",
  "\n",
  "For birth outcome data, the California Department of Public Health provides county-level birth statistics from 2010 to 2023. This dataset includes the number and percentage of low birth weight births per county. In this dataset, low birth weight is categorized based on a threshold value rather than reported as a continuous measure. The dataset also includes related variables such as preterm birth rates, which could be used for supplementary analysis.\n"

  "## Ethics \n",
  "\n",
  "### A. Data Collection\n",
  " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
  "\n",
  "This project uses publicly available county-level data and does not involve human subjects or individual-level records. Because the data are not linked to specific people, informed consent is not applicable.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
  "\n",
  "Our analysis is limited to California, which is generally wealthier and may have better healthcare access and stricter air quality regulations than other regions. As a result, our findings may not generalize beyond California. Additionally, county-level aggregation may hide within-county disparities, such as neighborhoods with higher pollution exposure or reduced access to prenatal care. We will explicitly acknowledge these limitations and avoid overgeneralizing our results.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
  "\n",
  "All datasets are aggregated at the county level and reported as averages or rates (e.g., PM2.5, ozone levels, and birth outcome rates). No personally identifiable information is collected or used, resulting in low privacy risk.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
  "\n",
  "Because we use aggregate public data without protected group identifiers, our ability to test downstream bias across specific demographic groups is limited.\n",
  "\n",
  "### B. Data Storage\n",
  " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
  "\n",
  "The data used are entirely public and aggregated, so they do not require special security measures beyond standard academic data handling practices.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
  "\n",
  "Because the project does not store personal or identifiable data, individual data removal requests are not applicable.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
  "\n",
  "Data will be retained only for the duration of the project and can be deleted after analysis is complete.\n",
  "\n",
  "### C. Analysis\n",
  " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
  "\n",
  "County-level data may fail to capture the experiences of smaller or more vulnerable communities within counties. We acknowledge that aggregation can obscure localized environmental and healthcare inequities and will discuss this limitation in our analysis.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
  "\n",
  "We recognize that observed relationships between air pollution and birth outcomes may be influenced by confounding factors such as income levels or access to healthcare. To mitigate misinterpretation, we will avoid causal claims and consider additional contextual variables where possible.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
  "\n",
  "Our visualizations and summaries will be clearly labeled and designed to reflect the data accurately, without exaggerating effect sizes or implying causation.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
  "\n",
  "No personally identifiable information is included in the analysis or visualizations.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
  "\n",
  "The analysis process will be documented and reproducible, allowing future reviewers to understand and reassess the results if needed.\n",
  "\n",
  "### D. Modeling\n",
  " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
  " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
  " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
  " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
  " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
  "\n",
  "We will clearly communicate that our findings are correlational, limited to California, and based on aggregated county-level data, and that unmeasured confounders may influence observed patterns.\n",
  "\n",
  "### E. Deployment\n",
  " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed?\n",
  " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results?\n",
  " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
  " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
  "\n",
  "There is a risk that results could be misinterpreted as causal or overgeneralized beyond California. To reduce this risk, we will explicitly state appropriate use cases and emphasize the limitations and scope of the analysis.\n"
