    "## Background and Prior Work",
"Our project examines whether prenatal exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5, µg/m³) is associated with differences in infant birth weight across racial and ethnic groups in California. We focus on identifying whether these effects vary by racial groups and how socioeconomic inequities may shape those differences. Birth weight disparities already exist across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. For example, non-Hispanic Black infants are nearly twice as likely to be born with low birth weight compared to non-Hispanic White infants even after accounting for other risk factors.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
"\n",
"According to the NIH, women have a “20% increase in oxygen consumption, a 40% to 50% increase in minute ventilation, and a 40% increase in cardiac output” when they are pregnant.<a name=\"cite_ref-1a\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This leads us to believe that pregnant women are more vulnerable to air pollution due to their increased intake and circulation of the particles. Moreover, an NIH study found that maternally inhaled carbonaceous air pollution particles can cross the placenta and then translocate into human fetal organs during gestation.<a name=\"cite_ref-1b\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) These studies suggest that air pollutants reach fetuses while they are in the womb. Since air pollutants are linked to a number of heart and lung problems, we are interested in investigating whether babies’ birth weights are affected by particulate exposure and whether this exposure exacerbates existing racial and ethnic disparities.\n",
"\n",
"Since air pollution is a major environmental health concern, fine particulate matter (especially PM2.5, particles ≤2.5 micrometers) can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Pregnancy is a particularly sensitive period to the effects of fine particulate matter because fetal growth depends on consistent oxygen and nutrient delivery. A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis examining prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and low birth weight pooled results from multiple cohort studies and found that exposure during pregnancy was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of low birth weight across trimesters.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) These findings support the hypothesis that higher levels of particulate air pollution can negatively impact fetal growth.\n",
"\n",
"Although there is convincing evidence that air pollution affects birth weight, there is limited research investigating whether the magnitude of impact differs across racial and ethnic groups. According to the CDC, “multiple studies have examined the relationship between PM2.5 and low birth weight, [but] few studies have been in a statewide representative sample or assessed for effect modification by poverty or race/ethnicity on that relationship.”<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Because a gap remains in understanding how air pollution interacts with racial and socioeconomic disparities, our project analyzes the relationship among these variables to address this deficiency.\n",

    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
